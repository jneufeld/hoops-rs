# hoops in rust

Puzzles from leetcode, project euler, hackerrank, exercism, etc. Some serve only to demonstrate basic competency in Rust. Some are documanted solutions to the data-structure-and-algorithm class of interview question. The rest are harder problems that, to be honest, I was too grumpy to document or optimize.
